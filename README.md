# The Project Idea
"Who wants to be a programmer?"
A browser game that allows players to expand their knowledge of the Python programming language. The game is conducted in a similar way to the well-known game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", but instead of trivia and general knowledge questions, the participants will be presented with questions on various topics related to the Python programming language.
In addition to the game option, the site will contain an abbreviated guide for beginner players in which the user can get an impression of the game and understand in depth how to play and use and flow the site.
Also, the user will be able to view his learning process which will be displayed on a graph that is updated regularly depending on the results of his games.
At the end, the system will display a detailed table of the top five players as of that time.
An admin panel will be set up for the site, where it will be possible to add additional questions, update existing questions and, if necessary, even delete irrelevant questions so that our system will always remain up-to-date.
